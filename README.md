# PHP SOLID

## What is SOLID?

SOLID is a set of five principles for object-oriented programming (OOP) that help developers design software that is easy to maintain, extend, and understand. The SOLID acronym stands for the following principles:

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** A class should have only one reason to change. This means that a class should have only one responsibility or job to do.

**Open-Closed Principle (OCP):** A class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a class without changing its existing code.

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. This means that you should be able to use a subclass wherever a superclass is expected without causing any errors or unexpected behavior.

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces that it does not use. This means that you should separate interfaces into smaller, more focused ones so that clients only need to depend on the interfaces that they actually use.

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This means that you should depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.
